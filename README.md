# Thesis Project â€“ Data Flow Analysis in the OMPi Compiler
This repository contains the implementation of my thesis work, which focuses on data flow analysis within the OMPi compiler.

# Overview
Data flow analysis is a fundamental technique used in compiler design to track how variables and expressions (the data of a program) are defined and used throughout a program. Its primary goal is to optimize code and detect potential issues during compilation.

In this project, I implemented a data flow analysis mechanism inside the OMPi compiler. The analysis was built using the internal data structures of OMPi, ensuring full integration with its architecture.
